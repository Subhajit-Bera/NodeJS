# NodeJS

## What is Node.js and why do we need it ?
**We have traditionally executed JavaScript within web browsers.Browser has a separate engine which compiles Js( chrome-> Chrome V8 engine).**</br>
Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment,runs on the V8 JavaScript engine.Means node.js provides us the engine to run JavaScript ,for that we are able to run JavaScript directly in the terminal and command prompt. So , with the help of node.js we can run JavaScript in the backend outside a web browser.
That's why Node Js is called a server-side language but basically it's a runtime environment.
